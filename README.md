# Java 2D Physics Engine (WIP)

This is a WIP 2D physics engine written in Java (planned JavaFX UI)

## Features So Far
- **Vector2D class**: Basic vector math (add, scale, etc.)
- **PhysicsObject class**: Represents physical objects with:
  - Mass
  - Position
  - Velocity
  - Acceleration
  - Ability to apply external forces
- **World class**:
  - Manages a list of physics objects
  - Applies gravity
  - Steps the simulation forward in time

## Not Yet Implemented
- Graphical UI
- Physics Visualization
- Big Chunk of Mechanics
- All of Electromagnetism

## Status
No UI, just mechanics and math under the hood.
VERY early WIP

## To Do
- Start building interactive UI (JavaFX)
- Add collision physics
- Add object path tracing
- Implement more Mechanics
